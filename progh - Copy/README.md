##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (or higher)
- Windows OS (required for WPF and `System.Media.SoundPlayer`)
- Visual Studio 2022+ **or** VS Code with the C# extension

### Run with Visual Studio

1. Open `CybersecurityBot.csproj` in Visual Studio.
2. Press **F5** or click **Start**.
3. The WPF window will launch.

### Run with the .NET CLI

```bash
cd CybersecurityBot
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

---

##  Optional Voice Greeting

Place a file named `greeting.wav` in the build output folder:

```
bin/Debug/net9.0-windows/greeting.wav
```

If the file is absent, the application continues silently without error.

##  Covered Topics

| Emoji | Topic |
|-------|-------|
|  | Passwords |
|  | Phishing & Scams |
|  | Safe Browsing & Internet Safety |
|  | Malware |
|  | Privacy |

|  | 2FA / MFA |
|  | VPN |
|  | Ransomware |
|  | Wi-Fi Security |
|  | Encryption |
|  | Data Breach |
|  | Hacking |
|  | Software Updates |
|  | Firewalls |

##  Architecture Notes

### Design patterns used

| Pattern | Where |
|---|---|
| **Delegate + Event** | `ConversationContext.OnActivity` — decoupled activity logging |
| **Strategy (delegate)** | `ResponseEngine.SelectResponse` — swappable response-selection logic |
| **Auto-properties** | `UserProfile`, `ConversationContext` — clean session state |
| **Sealed classes** | `Chatbot`, `UserProfile` — prevents unintended subclassing |
| **Static helpers** | `UI`, `InputValidator`, `SentimentDetector`, `ResponseEngine` — stateless utilities |

### Extending the response engine

Add a new entry to the `Responses` dictionary in `ResponseEngine.cs`:

```csharp
["your keyword"] = new[]
{
    "First alternative response.",
    "Second alternative response.",
},
```

Add the display label to `TopicList` and the UI chip will appear automatically.

##  Planned Improvements

- [ ] Integrate OpenAI / Claude API for true NLP responses
- [ ] Persist chat history and user preferences to disk
- [ ] Dark-mode theming toggle
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Export conversation transcript to PDF
- [ ] Web-based version (Blazor or React)
